            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>There are 7 books and 8 movies. The seventh book is divided into two movies. I’ll narrate the summaries of the books.

                1. An eleven year old boy, Harry Potter, who lives with his uncle, aunt and cousin, having lost his parents as an infant, finds out that he’s a wizard (someone with magical powers) and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                There he makes many friends, the best of them being Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. 
                A new teacher at the school that year is possessed by Lord Voldemort, the antagonist of the series, who partially lost his life when he failed to kill baby-Harry (difficult to explain in short). 
                He tries to steal a stone that’s guarded by the headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore, because it’s an elixir of life. 
                It’s up to the trio to try and stop him.
                
                2. Ron’s sister Ginny gets hold of an old diary which belonged to adolescent Voldemort through which anyone can communicate with him. 
                She doesn’t realize that it’s his and starts using the diary to the extent of getting possessed. 
                He uses her to open the Chamber of Secrets which houses a monstrous snake that especially targets muggle borns (non magic people). 
                The snake is set loose and many people are hurt (including Hermione). 
                Harry and Ron are bound to solve the issues and save everyone including Hermione and Ginny.
                
                3. A prisoner escapes from Azkaban (the prison of the magical world) and he turns out to be Harry’s Godfather, Sirius Black, who happened to be his parents’ best friend. 
                He’s under the misconception that Sirius was the reason for their death. Sirius, meanwhile, arrives at Hogwarts (in the form of a dog) to attack the person who actually was the cause of Harry’s parents’ death.
                Interestingly, this guy is Ron’s rat (yes he can change forms too). 
                Everyone thinks Sirius is after Harry while in fact he’s just after the rat. 
                In the series of events that follow, Harry realizes that Sirius is innocent and tries to save him from the prison guards (called Dementors) who suck the soul out of people (literally).
                
                4. There’s a competition called the Tri-Wizard Tournament between three wizarding schools and it’s extremely dangerous. 
                Someone nominates Harry’s name though he’s under-age and he’s chastised by people because they think he did it himself for fame. 
                He survives the tournament and with another student of Hogwarts, Cedric, reached the trophy first. They both touch it at the same time and are transported to another place. 
                That’s where Voldy is trying to come back to life. He and his side-kick (the rat in the third part who escaped) were expecting only Harry, so Cedric is killed. 
                They take Harry’s blood and Voldy gets his body back (he did not have a proper one after the event described in the first part when Harry was an infant). 
                Then Harry somehow escapes with Cedric’s body.
                
                5. Very few people believe that Voldy’s back. Even the Ministry of Magic is ignorant and they tag Harry and Dumbledore as liars. 
                The trio form a group of students and name it Dumbledore’s Army and train them to face Voldy some day. 
                Towards the end of the book they set off to the ministry to get hold of a prophecy regarding Harry and Voldemort, and end up being attacked by Voldy’s people.

                6. This story is mostly about a book owned by “The half blood prince”, whose name I’m not revealing. 
                Harry learns more about Voldemort’s life and how he’s divided his life into little parts and put them in different objects like the diary in the 2nd part, a ring, a locket, etc.
                
                7. The trio set out to destroy the parts mentioned in #6, the world having been taken over by Voldemort and his people. It’s way too interesting to be summarized.
                
                    This is one of the best series ever written and no summary can ever do it any justice. 
                I’d really recommend you to read the books, or at least watch the movies. 
                I did not elaborate on a lot of details because I did not want to give away spoilers.
                Trust me, you won’t regret watching/reading it.</p>
